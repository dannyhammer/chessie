# Chessie Types

Contains primitives types for the [`chessie`](https://crates.io/crates/chessie) crate.

All types are re-exported by [`chessie`](https://crates.io/crates/chessie), so you shouldn't need to use this crate directly for any reason.

However, if you'd like to use this in your own projects, you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/dannyhammer/chessie).
